# üî• GIF INTENSIFIER üî•

> [!warning]
> **AI-POWERED DISCLAIMER** 
> This entire codebase was vibe-coded with Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the driver. I simply had a goal and Claude made it happen. The AI was a means to an end, and that end is **intensifying your images**.

## What Even Is This?

Remember when the internet decided that shaking things violently made them funnier? Yeah, this is that. 

GIF Intensifier takes your boring, static images and transforms them into glorious, seizure-inducing, rapidly vibrating masterpieces. It's the digital equivalent of putting googly eyes on everything, except instead of eyes, it's **uncontrollable shaking**.

## Cultural Context (AKA Why Does This Exist?)

In the ancient times of the mid-2010s internet, a meme format emerged: the "intensifies" GIF. You'd see things like:

- `[BREATHING INTENSIFIES]`
- `[CONCERN INTENSIFIES]`
- `[ANXIETY INTENSIFIES]`

These were typically accompanied by an image that shook violently to convey emotional escalation. It was beautiful. It was stupid. It was the internet at its finest.

This tool exists because sometimes you just need to make something shake uncontrollably, and you don't want to fire up some bloated video editing software to do it. 

## Features

- üì§ **Upload images** (PNG, JPEG, WebP - we're not savages)
- üéöÔ∏è **Control the chaos** with adjustable shake intensity
- üé¨ **Customize frame count** (more frames = smoother seizures)
- ‚ö° **Adjust frame delay** (faster = more intense)
- üíæ **Download your creation** and spread the chaos

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Drop an image or click to upload
3. Adjust the sliders until it feels *right*
4. Click "Generate GIF"
5. Download and deploy your weapon of mass vibration

## Technical Details (For the Nerds)

- Pure vanilla JavaScript because we don't need a framework for shaking images
- Uses the `omggif` library for GIF encoding
- Canvas API for the actual image manipulation
- All client-side processing (your images never leave your computer)
- Single HTML file because deployment complexity is for cowards

## Why "Vibe-Coded"?

Because I didn't write a single line of this myself. I just vibed with Claude about what I wanted, and it manifested the code into existence. Even this readme. This is the future, folks. We're all just prompt engineers now.

## License

Do whatever you want with this. Make it shake harder. Make it shake softer. Make it shake in 3D for all I care.
